let's educate not only the women but also the men of future generations about it and
eradicate the stigma that is associated with periods.\n\n
Teach your children about menstruation\n
not only for your daughters but also for your sons. 
So that at the time of Periods they know about what to do instead of getting abhor.\n
He would know how to be helpful to his mother, wife, daughter. \n\n
